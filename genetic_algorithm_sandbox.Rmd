## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
if (!require(tidyverse)){
  install.packages('tidyverse')
}
library(tidyverse)

if (!require(readxl)){
  install.packages('readxl')
}
library(readxl)

if (!require(writexl)){
  install.packages('writexl')
}
library(writexl)

if (!require(GA)){
  install.packages('GA')
}
library(GA)

```
